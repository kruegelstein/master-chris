This project contains the three mobile gaming apps used in the master thesis of Christopher Kr√ºgelstein.

Below you will find some information on how to setup the apps on your local maschine.

# Basis infos

The three gaming apps developed are:

- Simon says
- Breakout
- Fruit Ninja

The basic technology used in all three games is ReactJS. ReactJS is a JavaScript library developed by Facebook which powers many web-applications on the internet. Combined with ReduxJS, which is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps, we use very powerfull state of the art technologies to build the three web-based gaming applications.

In the Breakout game we additionally use a digital canvas to support movement within the game.

# Setup

This guide will give you a brief overview on how to setup all three games on your local maschine using the command line tool.

**Note: This guide is written for MacOS. The steps for Windows and Linux are the same but the commands might be different.**

## Requirements

In order to setup this project locally you will need:

- Internet connection
- Node package manager (npm) or yarn installed. You can check that with `npm -v` or `yarn -v` in your command line tool. If you get a version back it is installed. If not please install either npm or yarn.
  1.  npm: https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm
  2.  yarn: https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install#mac-stable
- Very basic command line knowlegde

## Create a local folder for the project

In your command line tool:

- Navigate to the folder your code is usualy placed: `cd path/where/you/want/the/folder`
- Create a folder named for example "MasterProject": `mkdir MasterProject`

**Note: If you name the folder differently please make sure to use that name instead of "MasterProject" throughout this setup guide!**

## Clone the git repository

- Navigate into the "MasterProject" folder: `cd MasterProject`
- Clone the Repo: `git clone https://github.com/kruegelstein/master.git`

## Checkout the structure

After cloning the project you find a folder called "master". This folder contains a folder for every game named "breakout", "fruit-ninja" and "simon". Within each of the games folders you find the code belonging to the given game.

**Note: All three games are created using create-react-app. This package creates a new basic ReactJS application will most of the setup you need to start your own application.**

## Installing the packages

Each ReactJS application will have so called packages you need to install before you can run the application. Therefore each game has its own `package.json` file on root within each games folder. This file basically manages the application. It holds informations about used packages so called dependencies and scripts for starting, testing, etc. the app.

- Navigate into the breakout game (if you are in "MasterProject"): `cd master/breakout`
- Install all the packages using npm or yarn: `npm install` or `yarn`. Depending on you maschine and the used packages this might take a litte bit.
- Repeat the steps for the other two games:
- Navigate into fruit-ninja (if you are in "MasterProject"): `cd master/fruit-ninja`
- Install all the packages using npm or yarn: `npm install` or `yarn`
- Navigate into simon (if you are in "MasterProject"): `cd master/simon`
- Install all the packages using npm or yarn: `npm install` or `yarn`

Now you have everything installed to start the apps locally.

## Start the games

Since every game has different dependencies (packages) you need to start every game on its own.

- You do so by navigating into the app(s) (if you are in "MasterProject"): `cd master/breakout` or `cd master/fruit-ninja` or `cd master/simon`
- Start the app with: `npm start` or `yarn start`. This will open a local server running on port 3000 with the given app.
- Now go to Chrome or your favorite browser and open: `localhost:3000`. The app with your started game is now running.

**Note: You can also start all games by running `npm start` or `yarn start` in the different tabs in your console in the corresponding games folder. The other two games will then run on `localhost:3001` and `localhost:3002`**
